Bookshare is an app in which users can add books (NOT MOVIES) they want to share with other people to a public tableview. In the tableview users can reserve and delete books. If the user presses a cell information about the book is shown via the google books API. The tableview is updated realtime via firebase.

notes 
- Only the first view makes use of state restoration
- Data is stored locally in userdefaults to autologin users when they quit the app without logging out.
